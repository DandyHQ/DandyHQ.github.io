### Minutes - 10 April

[Return to index](../index.html)

There wasn't much to report this week. Everyone is still working on the same things. 

ubuntu is now installed (via VirtualBox?) on Hannah's computer, for mace testing/work.

The report is nearing completion (due 13 April). We talked a bit about what we wanted to put in the report, what we thought was actually expected of the report, and whether or not we should reserve some details for the second report.
