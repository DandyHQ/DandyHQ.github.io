### Minutes - 3rd April

[Return to index](../index.html)

#### Progress since last week
* We have a preliminary draft of the draft for the report
* Vaughan has made a lot of progress with the prototype (including a live demo)
* Mytchel set up Lua (currently just for font configuration)
* Mytchel set up and assigned some tasks on GitHub
* Ryan started tinkering with the source code, trying to implement pane resizing

#### Discussion about features
* We had another discussion about which features we actually wanted for version 1.0.
* We decided against including regular expressions, terminal capabilities, backup files and all the other features previously described as non-essential
* Features for version 1:
  * moveable tabs, tiles
  * usable, editable command bar
  * folder view
  * works on ubuntu, openBSD and fedora
  * basic undo, but not special undo
  * ability to open and edit text files
* The true sexiness of the interface might be put on hold for now

#### Other discussions
* Make vs Meson
  * Meson is fast and pretty (sexy interface), but not necessarily as universal as make
  * Meson might make testing easier
  * I don't think we came to a firm conclusion on this yet
* We talked about how the user should resizing panes
  * mouse (small bars to click on) or keyboard (a little unusual)
* We talked about setting up a testing framework with Unity
* We talked a bit about what we were going to put in the report

#### Tasks for next week
* Hannah and Ryan are going to work on the report (due 14 April)
* Vaughan is going to work on the prototype (improving tab dragging)
* Hannah was going to look at font config
* Ryan was going to look at pane resizing some more
* Mytchel was going to keep doing his thing, which I didn't write down apparently
