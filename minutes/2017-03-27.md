### Minutes - 27th March

[Return to index](../index.html)

#### Discussion about product design
* We went over the [full list of features](../features.html) we wanted for Mace.
* Features were roughly categorised by importance (from crucial to unimportant)
* We talked about where we would want error messages (e.g. from executing bad commands on the command bar) to go
  * errors are printed in a new tab? One tab for all error messages, or does each tab/window get its own error tab?
  * we don't want error messages to intrude
  * we also don't want error messages to disappear before they can be inspected fully
* We talked about wanting to minimise pop-ups
* We talked about the idea of *lean startup* (starting with minimal features and building upwards
* We decided that the client-server architecture would be put on the backburner (at least for now), due to implementation difficulties

#### Miscellany
* The etymology and alleged misuse of the word "argument"
* German pedagogy and Latin chanting
