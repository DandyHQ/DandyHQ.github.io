### Minutes - 8th May

[Return to index](../index.md)

#### Progress
* Ryan wrote up a rough schedule for the month (and we're basically on track so far!)
* Mytchel implemented text selection and the backend for commands.
* A lot of the code is a lot tidier now too.

#### Issues
* We're currently using Lua for managing the text engine and commands. We also want to use Lua for memory management, but we need to make sure that would be allowed...
* We talked about restructuring text pieces into a binary tree for faster (O(log n)) searching.

#### Tasks
* Work on Lua stuff (Mytchel)
* Look at binary structure for text pieces (Ryan)
* Check with Andrew about using Lua for memory management (Hannah)
* Begin looking into syntax highlighting (Hannah & Ryan)
